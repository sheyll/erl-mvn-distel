Smoother integration of the erlang-plugin for maven with distel and emacs.

Getting Started
---------------

The ~/.emacs file should contain the statements necessary to load the erlang and 
distel modes. Add the following lines _after_ Distel and Erlang mode:

    ;Erlang Maven and Distel intergration
    (add-to-list 'load-path "<erl-mvn-distel-path>")
    (require 'erl-mvn)
    (erl-mvn-setup)

Basic Usage
-----------

Open an erlang file that is part of a maven project. A minor mode called "Erl-Mvn" will be activated and
provides menus with the function currently available.
Currently not all menu entries work, as I have not found out, how to dectivate a menu entry jet.

After opening an erlang file, click on "Erl-Mvn -> Setup Erlang Node" to start and configure an erlang node.
Maven will be called, in order to upload the modules and all dependencies. 
Note it is necessary that the project compiles without error at this point, otherwise the necessary setup
can not complete. It is not necessary that all tests pass.
