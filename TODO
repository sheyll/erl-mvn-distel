TODOs
-----

* FIX: erlang source buffer highlighting doesn't work anymore

* watch active projects and set distels nodename accordingly

* add a check only flag to buffer compilation so that pre-save action checks can be made

* add quick syntax check with after-change-functions

* abstract artifact-id away, using a function "erl-mvn-get-project-id pom-file"

* add (error ...) where appropriate


* use overlays instead of text properties to highlight errors
