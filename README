Smoother integration of the erlang-plugin for maven with distel and emacs.

Getting Started
---------------

The ~/.emacs file should contain the statements necessary to load the erlang and 
distel modes. Add the following lines _after_ Distel and Erlang mode:

    ;Erlang Maven and Distel intergration
    (add-to-list 'load-path "<erl-mvn-distel-path>")
    (require 'erl-mvn)
    (erl-mvn-setup)

Basic Usage
-----------

To make erl-mvn aware of a maven project, open a source file and run 

    M-x erl-mvn-open-project

After that saving a source file in a source directory of a maven project added that way,
causes it to be compiled using the build information returned by the maven run.

The erlang maven plugin is instructed to upload all modules including test modules and the 
project dependencies to the erlang node started by erl-mvn.

Several other functions exist. Please do a 

    M-x erl-mvn-<TAB> 

to see them. They are documented, so that the standard help function, invoked by

    C-h f erl-mvn-...

will display the description.
